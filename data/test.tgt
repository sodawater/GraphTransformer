resolutely support the thread starter ! i compose a poem in reply :
pledge to fight to the death defending the diaoyu islands and the related islands
fleets bumping fishing boats . little evil japanese ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . with hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance
never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . china be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies !
september 11 th , 2010
i agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . if war really comes , i would like to be hua mulan , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our china , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity .
i very much wish i had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of mao zedong , the long march , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong china , spreading our dragon prestige !
how long are we going to tolerate japan ?
my fellow citizens :
hello , everyone ! we all know the " september 18 th " incident , but now japan again has a premeditated plan for another " september 18 th " on the sea , another " lugou bridge on the sea ".
