resolutely support the thread starter ! i compose a poem in reply :
pledge to fight to the death defending the diaoyu islands and the related islands
fleets bumping fishing boats . little evil japanese ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . with hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance
never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . china be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies !

i agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . if war really comes , i would like to be hua mulan , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our china , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity .
i very much wish i had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of mao zedong , the long march , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong china , spreading our dragon prestige !
how long are we going to tolerate japan ?
my fellow citizens :
hello , everyone ! we all know the " september 18 th " incident , but now japan again has a premeditated plan for another " september 18 th " on the sea , another " lugou bridge on the sea ".
japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , " the diaoyu islands ".
as we all know , the " diaoyu islands " have always belonged to china ; due to historical reasons , what originally belongs us has become controversial .
my fellow citizens , ours is ours , what need is there to negotiate ! japan thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation . can we allow this ? no - absolutely not !
my fellow citizens , japan 's militarism has brought the people of asia grave disasters .
especially china suffered the ravages of japan for as long as several decades .
in the northeast , japanese unit 731 cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of china , korea and other countries , the method of which were extremely brutal ; the nanjing massacre added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battles at hengyang and changsha laid bare the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers and killed off everything ...
my fellow citizens , of the heinous crimes committed by japan in china , there are too many instances to cite , difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips .
it 's just as if those ten million deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the pacific ocean , finding it difficult to rest in peace .
all the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks , and our blood boils with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read !
now japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens , fellow chinese in asia , wake up !
although it is painful to look back at these hundred years of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issues have not been resolved , let us create and choose history !
since there is responsibility , we are not afraid . the territory is small , but it is related to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the winds and clouds changes , the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor ; even though scarred with wounds , we can not let our native lands be separated !
my fellow citizens , for the chinese nation , the advent of the twenty @-@ first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside , and we will face many challenges .
the taiwan issue , the tibet issue , the south china sea issue , the surrounding environment , as well as the foreign forces which are aggressive to china - which way should we go ?
what to do , fellow citizens ? please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent @-@ shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing , strangling our development , and coveting our national territory .
we do not want to make enemies , but are never afraid of enemies ; we do not want war , but are never afraid of war .
we must urgently arrange arms , strengthen all military forces on land , on sea , and in the air .
over thousands of years , the chinese nation has flourished several times , but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward .
not imposing on others what we do n't want ourselves , what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue .
the tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others , but must insist on not being hurt ourselves .
tolerance is certainly not fear , and sincerity does not have to be cowardice .
china exempting japan from war reparations for world war ii was in service of peace , benevolent peace .
my fellow citizens , the people 's heroes monument is a condensed history of the chinese nation striving for continuous self @-@ improvement
the solemn and magnificent posture represents a sacred expectation for peace .
the thought @-@ strings of my memory have been agitated from time to time - many heroic , stirring , and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses spring up in my mind .
my thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history , as if i saw emperor kangxi , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , hundreds of years ago ; also as if i saw abraham lincoln , former u.s. president , wandering alone in the dark of a great hall , thinking about the integrity of the union .
" although it is peaceful throughout the world , it is certainly dangerous to forget war ! " my fellow citizens , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . the " boxer protocol " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated china 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied .
without strength , where does peace come from !
we must focus on national defense education , build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend ;
the best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra @-@ long @-@ range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distances . on the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high @-@ quality , high @-@ tech elite division .
the battle horn is about to sound , the people are already fully equipped and ready to go .
without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all @-@ powerful .
my fellow citizens , it is time for us to say " no " to others . therefore , we must achieve :
1. establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to china the hundreds of thousands of it professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the united states and around the world .
2. create a few nuclear @-@ powered aircraft carrier battle groups .
3. manufacture 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds .
4. accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles .
5. resume nuclear experiments , and establish military forces in space .
6. retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to ten million tons of tnt , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short @- and middle @-@ range missiles .
7. retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .
8. abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapons first .
9. retain the right of pre @-@ emptive strike when national security is threatened .
my fellow citizens , only if we have self @-@ confidence and self @-@ improvement , can we strive to be strong . qin shi huang unified china . zheng chenggong recovered taiwan . in our responsibilities we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessors .
now , that piece of land trembling far away from the embrace of the motherland is shaking , moaning , and calling . fellow citizens , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals , moving forward courageously !
when reading over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . although i was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland being splendid once again , i am willing to voluntarily serve our country , and i will have no regrets even if i die ! my sincere patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven !
here , i 've composed a poem in classical ci form , to voice the aspirations of my heart .
paint the deep red lips
protect the diaoyu islands
bitterly lost our ryukyu islands
how can we allow the diaoyu islands to fall to other countries
one hundred years of vicissitudes
smoke and clouds chase the flying waves
youngest brother is still a tender youth
wandering in all directions , bearing a seal
looking over to the flag
brandish our weapons and cross to the east
let the horses drink from the pacific ocean

why do n't we fight with little japan ?
what do chinese still tolerate ...
they are riding even on our head
is this still what chinese with guts do ?
we should tell the whole world , that chinese can n't be bullied at will by others ...
it is time to show our strength ! china has been calm for too long !
currently our citizens ' lives are all too carefree ! the officials are too extravagant .
now we already have no cohesion ! china needs to start a war ! a harsh slap in the face of the countries which follow the united states ' rear !
let them know that the us is not a panacea ! if we win , it may increase china 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! if we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrats , and make those trash get out ! let china have new blood and get updated . , get up , china !
go , china , go
i suggest that china strengthens the guard on the diaoyu islands , make it daily , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if japan dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small @-@ scale war of self @-@ defense , regardless of the cost . china can not lose !
we need shows in life , but it is really p. to show yourself within someone 's embrace .
i 'm just passing by
the whole society is like this , not to mention the stars
damn it being not sexy
it 's totally unacceptable
agree , just cheap entertainers . their reputation in feudal china somewhat makes sense .
their life looks glorious
a group of people of nine professions
life is hard .
:shocked :
that 's normal , it has always been the case that a whore is heartless and a performer is unrighteous
they want money , not the face
have a look at the " wolf with glasses " near ms. fan , you will know the actress has no choice but drink with him or she will be forced out or even framed .
sob
it 's ok as long as there is something to eat :loveliness :
no one is easy . life is like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform
all are sb
there are top scorer in the imperial examination in all 360 walks of life ! what effort and endeavor behind those top scorer in the imperial examination ! this is humiliating the word " bean vermicelli "!
haha
overdoing
