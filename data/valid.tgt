there are many who have a sense of urgency , quietly watching how things develop , you are dragons coiling , you are tigers crouching , i admire noble @-@ minded patriots .
has history given us too many lessons ? , 530 , 412 , 64
taking a look
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people : even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
what is more they are considered traitors of china , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
in fact , the us no longer needs to use force to deal with china , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting ".
is the article too intense , is the united states so good ?
if things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , three people create a tiger .
just passing by and taking a look . won't express my opinion
came to study and learn
very attractive
it should vigorously advocated
some people - do n't forget you are chinese ; if the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness !
i really especially hate those who are eating chinese things and drinking chinese things , but who say america is so whatever , those dogs , if america is so good go find your american illegitimate fathers
i feel our people should learn more from the dprk , the banner of socialism needs to be held , but mao zedong thought can n't be forgotten !
only mao zedong thought , can save the nation !
there too many traitors of china !
patriotism is the bottom line . everyone must prove worthy of the nation
i think it is not those elites , but that some corrupt officials were bribed
remove this group of jerks !
i 'm just taking a look
there are so many traitors in the history of china - we need to be vigilant .
with the chaos in east and north africa , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with western imperialism .
everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in china , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .
it won't be long until people are coming from all directions to the chinese court . leading the world . this is the intent of heaven .
following with interest .
this just is a specialty of modern china there 's nothing we can do
there are too many traitors among our compatriots ,
freedom of speech is relative . we need take national conditions into account .
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
to the person who said this i 'd like to ask which one of those mentioned above is your dad

support , bump
in critical moments , we are all descendants of yan emperor and huang emperor .
look at the kuomintang @-@ communist cooperation of those years and you will know ...
in the peaceful years , creating a ruckus does n't influence everybody cooperating when it 's time for war ...
it can compete with articles from the cultural revolution , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .
the fifth column will make those with vested interests in the communist party terrified , it 's a good thing
if you want to destroy a people , first of all is his national culture , whose tool is language and writing . currently the one which everyone who is going to the next grade or entering a higher school must all be tested on is english @-
-@ turn
you are a dragon coiling , you are a tiger crouching , it makes sense , wait for the opportunity
in fact , us no longer needs to use force to deal with china , they have reached a result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " ...
yes . there are many slaves of foreigners . it 's time we should renovate !
the ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of china ! comrade deng xiaoping once said that the communist party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . former us ambassador to china mr. huntsman once said in a speech in the us : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in china , let the chinese themselves topple china - and the cia then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .
i have reasons to say this : these last several days i have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse i see they are disciples of wang jingwei !
western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
the domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . can we blame others for this ?
saying that someone is bribed is improper ?
people are all selfish , reality also is often gray .
some propaganda activities of zf have soon become viewed as jokes by the people .
in this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit ?
we can n't look over the old accounts of the previous so @-@ called anti @-@ japanese war .
take a look at north korea , that 's our country many years ago . take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
the united states ' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .
these days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense : it 's that america , through long @-@ term bribing of the chinese intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a " fifth column ".
these people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote american values* and brainwash the chinese people on behalf of the americans .
why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense ?
because these days , i 've been reading part of the " specialist professor " blog , it would have been okay if i did n't read it , but after i read it , it made me really surprised .
for example , assistant professor zhang ming of renmin university , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .
such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in china to elementary school textbooks having " wang erxiao ", and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
another example is so @-@ called " sexologist " and " social activist " li yinhe - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise " haite sexology report "; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions .
she main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown ,
this kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine .
like in the essay " a bit less hostility , a bit more harmony ", she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti @-@ pornography @-@ and @-@ illegal @-@ publications drive as social hostility ;
in the essay " china has already become the country which worships money most on the earth ", she attributes chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay " are you studying paul or studying bill ? ", she blathers that " people who study paul will become terrorists ";
in the essay " recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products ", she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the beijing anti @-@ pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc.
especially today 's masterpiece , " why is it worth paying such close attention to the jianghe obscene goods case ? ", where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by beijing city , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people ."
but these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by sina blog is really preposterous !
and there is also sichuanese poet liu shahe , who , while america clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of china and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy " china and america are friendly ", and tries to pour spirit @-@ confusing soup on the chinese people willfully and without fear ;
yi zhongtian , who got famous by remarking upon the " three countries ", whose talent and learning i have always respected , but i did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of china , mao yushi , saying some things like " i believe whoever disrespects mao yushi is not human ", once again making me very much drop my glasses !
also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " complete notes on 100 chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the ford foundation ", i feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in china who are " becoming treasonous " are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .
but i do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
contacting " southern newspapers ", which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , i feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities !
i remember , 60 @-@ some years ago the us had just fought a war with china , and still threatened china with the use of nuclear weapons ;
40 @-@ some years ago , the us entered vietnam with the intention of containing china ;
although 32 years ago it had established relations with china , 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on china , 12 years ago it bombed a chinese embassy , 10 years ago the south china sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it restarted its containment of china with great fanfare .
i do n't understand , why are we chinese so forgetful ?
why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the us ?
without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us chinese .
therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of china are rampaging and the fifth column is running rampant
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitors to china " among primary school students ?
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitors to china " among primary school students ?
just passing through , taking a look

mr. zhengqing , the things you say are quite astonishing , there possibly is a suspicion that there are fragments , even if they are a fifth column , they would n't be so bare @-@ boned , we should allow the existence of different opinions , the times are really different , no matter if its democracy or pan @-@ occidentalism , neither are beneficial to china , do n't be afraid , what do you say

little japan , born of dog feces and the dead us economy almost can n't survive . they are preparing to start a war , to pass on debt to others .
china can not be so " doctrine of the mean "~
if we greatly value making peace with wolves , we will pay a painful price !
if we act like a turtle , will the various powers let us off ? it 's time to abolish cultural troupes and sports teams ! use the funds on the front @-@ line of defense .
looking the territorial seas with smoke of beacon @-@ fires up everywhere , what can being a great sports and arts nation accomplish ?
it 's time to wake up ! the wrong thinking and policies of high @-@ level decision @-@ making should be amended
we should put our efforts to developing science and technology ; we will be beaten if left behind ; use the limited military expenses on commanders and soldiers on the front line !
